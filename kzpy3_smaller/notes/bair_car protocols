Always start roslaunch with car's wheels off the ground. In rare instances it can go to maximum throttle.

If there is a crash or flip or roll over, shut down the car via ssh. Check carefully for loosened connections.
Then reboot and continue.

Maintain TX1 battery at high level, greater than 11.4 V, on the theory that a lot of power is needed
for the flash drive and the ZED camera. Carry spare batteries. These 11.4 V batteries can be used for the
motor.

Need to save bag files in separate folders for each run.

Need to mount ZED properly: level, stable, and protected.
