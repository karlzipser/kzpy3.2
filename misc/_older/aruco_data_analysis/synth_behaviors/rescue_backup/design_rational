Requirements:

- Getting the model cars back to run autonomously safely in minimum time when stuck/crashed


Derived Requirements:

1 Monitor the state of the art of the car
2 Monitor the recent past states of the car to revert to past states
3 Being able to calculate a safe way to a safe state
4 Signalling the correction to the rest of the system to label it accordingly.
5 Being able to add behavior in an easy way

1.1. Receive steering and motor commands 
2.1. Receive steering and motor commands over sufficient timesteps in the past
3.1. Plan an appropriate safe path for each situation
3.1.1. Define and detect situations to react upon
3.1.2. Define and apply safe actions for each situation


Plan: Program a module which continously monitors the rostopics
and sends alternative steer/motor commands if necessary. 

- Pro: This should be testable / debuggable with old rosbags by simply
replaying them
